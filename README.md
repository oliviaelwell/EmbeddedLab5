# EmbeddedLab5
This repository contains the code for questions 1 and 2 for Lab 5 for Dr. Naher at Rowan University. The code for question one captures one sensor's analog data and processes the analog data internally into a digital sample. The code for question two captures the analog data from two different sensors and processes the analog data into the digital sample.
